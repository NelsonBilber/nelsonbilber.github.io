This is a blog about my Github experiments.<br>
This aim to explain the structure of repositories and how to navigate between them.


<br/>
**Unreal Engine**

--- 

Samples and drafts about code from udemy course ["The Unreal Engine Developer Course"](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4/)


* [Building Room](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/ue4.udemy.unrealcourse.buildingroom) <br/> A simple First Person game to learn level building, lighting, Unreal Editor, C++ game logic, basic Blueprint and more

* [Battle Tank](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/ue4.udemy.unrealcourse.battletank) <br/> An open-world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in Unreal 4

* [Testing Grounds](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/ue4.udemy.unrealcourse.testinggrounds) <br/> A Hunger-Games inspired FPS with large outdoor terrains. Advanced AI, basic networking, pickups, skeletal meshes, checkpoints and more


**Computer Graphics**

--- 


Explore computer graphics API's


* [DirectX](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/cg.directx) <br/> ... in progress ...

 

**C++**

--- 

It's a hard language to learn so it requires a lot of constant practice

* [Containers](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/cpp.containers) <br/> C++ Template Metaprogramming 
 
* [Loki](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/cpp.loki) <br/> Source Code from great book: "Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied 

* [Metaprogramming](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/cpp.metaprogramming)<br/> C++ Template Metaprogramming 

* [Modern C++](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/cpp.moderncpp) <br/> Nice walkthrough for C++, C++11/14/17, ..

* [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/cpp.oop) <br>

* [RAII](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/cpp.RAII) <br/>C++ Resource acquisition is initialization (RAII) 

* [Smart Pointers](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/cpp.smartpointers)<br/> Explore C++11 smartpointers 

* [STL](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/cpp.stl) <br/> C++ Standard Template Library (STL) 



**Design patterns**

---

Techniques for structure the code

* [MVVM](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/design.patterns.MVVM)



**Programming languages**

---


There's some space for other programming languages

* [C#](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/programming-languages)

* [Java](https://github.com/NelsonBilber/programming-languages)
